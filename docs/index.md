## 📦 Download & Installation


Download binary files for Ubuntu and Windows from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/niwciu/ModbusSniffer/releases).

You can also install directly from pip or build and install the app from sources. [Click here](CONTRIBUTING.md#build--install) for details.

## 🖥️ User Interface Overview

The graphical interface of ModbusSniffer is designed for clarity and usability. It consists of:

- **Top Toolbar**  
  Controls for connecting to a serial port, starting/stopping sniffing, and additional options such as logging to file or exporting logs to CSV.

- **Main Display Area**  
  Two switchable views:
  - **Table View**: Displays Modbus requests and responses in real time, with sortable columns.
  - **Console View**: A terminal-like display with color-coded request–response pairs, useful for quick scanning and debugging.

- **Filters Panel**  
  Allows filtering captured traffic by device ID, function code, or register address to focus on specific devices or operations (currently under development).

## 📚 How It Works

ModbusSniffer opens a serial port and passively listens to the incoming data stream. It continuously scans the raw byte stream for valid Modbus RTU frames using protocol-specific timing and structure rules.

Each detected frame is decoded to extract key information such as device address, function code, and data content.

Depending on the selected mode and view:

- In the GUI, frames can be:

  - displayed in a real-time tabular view with sorting and filtering options, or

  - shown in a terminal-like log view where each request–response pair is grouped and color-coded. Alternating colors help visually separate transactions, and invalid or unanswered frames are highlighted in red.

- In the CLI, frames are printed line-by-line to standard output. The format and verbosity of output depend on command-line flags passed by the user.

> ℹ️ Tip: For safe, non-intrusive monitoring of Modbus RTU traffic, use a passive RS-485 tap or a USB-to-RS485 adapter configured to listen-only. This allows ModbusSniffer to capture data without sending or disturbing any signals on the bus.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I use ModbusSniffer with USB-to-RS485 converters?**  
Yes! ModbusSniffer works out of the box with any USB-to-RS485 converter that exposes a standard COM port.

**Q: Is it safe to use ModbusSniffer on a live Modbus bus?**  
Absolutely. The application is passive — it only listens and does not transmit any data, so it won’t interfere with normal communication.

**Q: Can I decode custom or proprietary Modbus function codes?**  
Not yet. Support for custom function code decoding is planned for a future release.

**Q: How can I run ModbusSniffer?**  
The easiest way is to download the pre-built binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/niwciu/ModbusSniffer/releases) run the app.  
You can also install it via PyPI.
Alternatively, You can clone the repository and run the script manually or run build&install script inside the repo.  
For quick guide look at [▶️ Usage](#️-usage) section.  
For more information albut build & install can be found [here](CONTRIBUTING.md#️-build--install)

**Q: Is there an installer that adds ModbusSniffer to system programs with shortcuts and icons?**  
No, there is no official installer package. However, by following the instructions in the CONTRIBUTING.md file under the Build & Install section, you can clone the repository and run the build script. This script compiles the application from source, creates binaries, and adds shortcuts to the system pointing to the built binaries.

> ⚠️ Important: The build script generates binaries inside the project folder and creates shortcuts referencing those binaries. It does not modify system files. Therefore, do not delete the binary folder after installation, or shortcuts will stop working.

## ▶️ Usage

### 🎛️ Running the GUI

**If using a binary (downloaded or built):**  
Just run the app like any other executable — no terminal required.

**If installed via pip:**  
```bash
modbus-sniffer-gui
```

**If running directly from the cloned repository:**  
Navigate to the source folder and run the GUI script:
```bash
cd src/modbus_sniffer
python gui.py
```

---

### 🖥️ Running the CLI

To see all available options:
```bash
modbus-sniffer -h
```

Example: Running the sniffer on `/dev/ttyUSB0` with baud rate `115200` and no parity:
```bash
modbus-sniffer -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200 -r none
```
